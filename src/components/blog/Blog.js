            JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
            compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information
            between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified
            and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using
            a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair
            using RSA or ECDSA. Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide
            secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed
            tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it,
            while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When
            tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also
            certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one
            that signed it

            <b>NodeJS : </b>
            NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime
            environment that allows the javascript to be run on the server-side.
            Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs
            comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development.
            <br />
            <b>JavaScript : </b>
            Javascript is a Scripting language. It is mostly abbreviated as JS.
            It can be said that Javascript is the updated version of the ECMA
            script. Javascript is a high-level programming language that uses
            the concept of Oops but it is based on prototype inheritance.

            NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
            EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
            architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop
            that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener
            for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process the request without I/O
            blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and
            sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible
            to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster
            module or worker_threads module.
